# tensorflow_video_processing
Video processing using Tensorflow to detect objects

## Purpose:
Video processing of a mp4 file, which uses Tensorflow to detect objects in the video's frames. Each frame processed has boundaries drawn around each identied object and is labeled accordingly. Each frame processed is outputed to a new video file called, "cars-detection.mp4"

## Files included:
- (VideoProcessingTensorflow.py) -the main file for execution
- (labels.txt) -a text file that includes all of the labeled data
- (cars.mp4) -the video being processed
- (cars-detection.mp4) -the final result of the video processing is included for viewing
